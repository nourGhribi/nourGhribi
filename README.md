## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Nour Ghribi!


I am a Data Scientist with expertise in analytics solutions, dashboard development, and translating complex data into actionable insights. Skilled in bridging technical and business domains, I promote data-driven decision-making with agile adaptability. Recently, I upskilled in Generative AI and LLMs, enhancing my ability to apply advanced data science techniques.

At [Effixis](https://effixis.ch/), I contribute to the design and deployment of Generative AI solutions that address evolving business challenges and drive technological modernization across industries.

I hold an M.Sc. in Data Science with a minor in Management of Technology and Entrepreneurship from EPFL, where I interned at Compagnie FinanciÃ¨re Tradition, contributing to their Data Science initiative. Fluent in English and French, I thrive in dynamic, multilingual environments. Naturally curious and creative, I am passionate about emerging technologies, design, and modern art forms.
